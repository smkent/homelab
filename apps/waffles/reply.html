Hi! ðŸ‘‹<br />
<br />

I'm Stephen's friendly robot, ðŸ§‡ Waffles.
Stephen receives a high volume of employment opportunities,
so I help get his eyes on the right ones!<br />
<br />

Stephen is based in Seattle (Pacific time zone), and is open to fully remote
roles that offer:

<ul>
<li>Strong compensation and benefits</li>
<li>Healthy work-life balance (No overtime or after-hours on-call)</li>
<li>Fair working conditions
    (No non-compete after employment
    or mandatory binding arbitration)</li>
</ul>

Washington's Equal Pay and Opportunities Act requires compensation range
disclosure with all employment solicitations (RCW 49.58.110). Please let me
know if the total compensation range for this role was included in your initial
message, or provide that info with your reply, and I'll show Stephen your email
right away! ðŸ“«<br />
<br />
